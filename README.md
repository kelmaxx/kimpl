Thank for trying out kimpl! 

kimpl is a package designed to extend the functionality of interactive tools in matplotlib. Where possible tools have been developed to be independent of which visualization backend, but some do depend on PyQt5.

kimpl was developed over several years as a graduate student at the University of Oregon with Dr. Cathy Wong and at the University of Texas at Austin with Drs. Sean Roberts and Carlos Baiz. 

1. Add an easy-to-use tool for saving and loading figures with their data. This is accomplished through the dill package.
2. Add a tool for copying the figure onto the clipboard. I was tired of saving my figure as a png and then copying it into a digital lab notebook.
3. Provide extra interactive tools for examining data. These are all stored under the Tools module.

To the best of my ability I have tried to mimic standard matplotlib naming, convention, and structure for the additions I have made.

I hope it is useful for others!
